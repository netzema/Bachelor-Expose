\section{Code and syntax highlighting}

You may sometimes want to add code snippets to your thesis. You can do so by using \texttt{lstlisting}. Use this with care, as code should not be extensively presented in the thesis. Here is an example. 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
def addition ():
    print("I am adding numbers here!")
    n = float(input("Enter the number: "))
    t = 0 // Total number enter
    ans = 0
    while n != 0:
        ans = ans + n
        t+=1
        n = float(input("Enter another number (0 to end): "))
    return [ans,t]
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Labels and References}
See \autoref{chap:introduction} for interesting stuff and see a cool logo in \autoref{fig:logo}. If you are still not convinced, try adding a footnote\footnote{did you like it?}. Its easy to add citations, just use a bibtex file to list your references and cite them here like this~\cite{988366}. If you want to read a cool paper~\cite{DBLP:conf/euromicro/DhunganaHW20}, just contact the author of the paper. Haha, that was funny! 


\section{Mathematical Equations and Expressions}
Basic equations in  \LaTeX{} can be easily "programmed". Fermat's Last Theorem (sometimes called Fermat's conjecture, especially in older texts) states that no three positive integers a, b, and c satisfy the equation \[ a^n + b^n = c^n \] for any integer value of $n$ greater than $2$. The cases $n = 1$ and  $n = 1$  have been known since antiquity to have infinitely many solutions. And because its so much fun, here is an integral for you - thank me later!  

\[ \int\limits_0^1 x^2 + y^2 \ dx \]

Do you want a more complex formula, I have no idea what it means, but it looks pretty. 

\[\oint_{i=1}^n \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s} 
= \prod_p \frac{1}{1 - p^{-s}} \]


\section{Enumerations and Descriptions}
Here is a simple list: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The labels consists of sequential numbers.
	\item The numbers starts at 1 with every call to the enumerate environment.
\end{enumerate}

Here is another list: 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The labels consists of sequential numbers.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The individual entries are indicated with a black dot, a so-called bullet.
		\item The text in the entries may be of any length.
	\end{itemize}
	\item The numbers starts at 1 with every call to the enumerate environment.
\end{enumerate}

Maybe such descriptions are also useful. These look neat to me. What do you think? Oh, I forgot, this document is not a tutorial. 
\begin{description}
	\item[Short] This is a shorter item label, and some text that talks
	about it. The text is wrapped into a paragraph, with successive
	lines indented.
	\item[Rather longer label] This is a longer item label.  As you can
	see, the text is not started a specified distance in -- unlike
	with other lists -- but is spaced a fixed distance from the end
	of the label.
\end{description}



\section{Adding images}
Adding a simple image is easy. Adding complex images is also easy. What is a complex image anyway? 
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{imclogo.png}
	\caption{IMC Logo}
	\label{fig:logo}
\end{figure}





\begin{figure}[ht]
	\begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}
		\centering
		% include first image
		\includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{imclogo.png}  
		\caption{Put your sub-caption here}
		\label{fig:sub-first}
	\end{subfigure}
	\begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}
		\centering
		% include second image
		\includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{imclogo.png}  
		\caption{Put your sub-caption here}
		\label{fig:sub-second}
	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Including sub images! }
	\label{fig:fig}
\end{figure}
