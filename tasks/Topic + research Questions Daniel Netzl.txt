Title:
Implementation and analysis of a machine learning approach to long-term values investing

Subtitle:
Minimize risk while maximizing cash flow through stock picking based on fundamental company data


Goal of the thesis:
The goal of this thesis is it to discover the possibilities of automating the value investing approach. Fundamental company data will be used to calculate the intrinsic
value and will hold as a basis for determining if a stock is worth buying now. The
aim is to beat the Vanguard FTSE All-World High Divididend Yield Index, which
would be the authorâ€™s alternative choice of investing money. The second approach
is considered as passive investing, only putting money on a regular basis into a
low-cost index fund. Backpropagation will be used to train and evaluate the model
on past and current data.
It is of utmost importance for the model to perform well over long period of time,
i.e. constantly over several years. Short-term success is mostly luck and can
often not be reproduced. The thesis will not cover any technical analysis for speculative short-term predictions of stock movements. The results of the model will be
evaluated on a yearly basis.
