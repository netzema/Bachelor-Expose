partical part of thesis:

	- define problem and data needed for calculations
	- get financial data from the web
	- feature engineering: build new features from given financial data
	- explore sources for qualitative data: analysts views, quality of management
	- do feature selection based on different correlation metrics
	- do calclations of intrinsic value emit buy signals
	- implement calcualtions in neural network and back propagate the calculations:
		> calculate intrinsic value of all stocks in real time
		> compare to current value of all stocks in real time
		> emit buy once the margin of safety is above a previously defined threshold
		> emit a sell signal once the current price exceeds the intrinsic value
		> track performance of holding windows over past data
	- How do my implementations help me answer the research question(s)
